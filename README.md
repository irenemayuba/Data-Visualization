**Power BI Data Analysis: Water Access and Service Efficiency Report**

**Overview**
This Power BI report analyzes water access, service efficiency, and demographic trends across multiple regions. The dashboard explores key metrics such as:
- Water source types (tap, well, river, etc.) and their usage
- Queue wait times by day, hour, and location
- Gender and age distribution in queues
- Regional disparities (urban vs. rural) in service delivery
- 
**Key Insights**
- Urban vs. Rural Divide: Urban areas serve significantly more people (63.85%) compared to rural regions (36.15%).
- Water Source Types: “Tap in home” is the most common water source, while “shared tap” and “river” sources indicate areas needing infrastructure improvement.

**Queue Trends:**
- Wait times peak on weekdays (especially Wednesday and Thursday) and during mid-day hours (12 PM–4 PM).
- Weekends show more balanced gender distribution in queues compared to weekdays.
- Regional Analysis: Provinces like Sokoto and Kitamori show high demand for water services, while others like Akatsi and Amanzi have lower engagement.

**Tools & Techniques**
- Data Visualizations: Bar charts, line graphs, maps, and pie charts
- Metrics: Sum of people served, average time in queue, gender/age percentages
- Filters: Day of week, hour of day, province, water source type
- DAX Measures: Custom calculations for averages, percentages, and sums
